    <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> cornstarch</li>
    <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> salt</li>
    <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> paprika</li>
    <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> onion powder</li>
    <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> garlic powder</li>
    <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> dried oregano</li>
    <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> dried basil</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce 
        (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. 
        Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and 
        refrigerate 4 hours.
    </li>
    <li>When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it 
        is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees
    </li>
    <li> Prepare the breading by combing the flour, cornstarch, onion power, 
        garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, 
        and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. 
        Mix it thoroughly.
    </li>
    <li>Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. 
        Shake it gently to remove excess. Place it in the breading mix and 
        coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.
    </li>
    <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at 
        a time. The chicken will drop the tempature of the oil so keep it as close 
        to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece 
        turning each piece about halfway through, until the chicken reaches 
        an internal tempature of 165 degrees F.
    </li>
    <li> Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest 
        for at least 10 minutes befgore serving. Enjoy!
